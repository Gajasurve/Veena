This is a small WhatsApp bot I built for myself — to start my mornings and focusing on surviving the day. 

* What it sends (Every day at 4 AM):
* 10 Names of Lord Vishnu
From the Shahasranama Stotra (1008 names of Vishnu)

Each name is shown in 2 lines:

One line in English transliteration

One line with simple meaning or thought

I read them slowly, reflect for a moment, and try to carry that energy through the day. It reminds me of you.

* Today’s Basic Panchang (Indian Calendar Info)
Before the names, the bot also shows a short daily Panchang:

Day (Vāra), Tithi, Nakshatra, Maas, Ritu, etc.

Just a small way to stay connected with time in the traditional way — like how our elders did.

*  Why I Made This is 
I used to wake up and check sad things or re-read old chats and bring grief,  first thing in the morning.
This messages in the morning help me understand that i am destined for this pain. I am happy that you gets the better part.

It’s simple:
Wake up → Check WhatsApp → Read Vishnu names → Try to survive the day. 

just schedule it in corntab #0 4 * * * /wwebjs-bot/Core.sh.
